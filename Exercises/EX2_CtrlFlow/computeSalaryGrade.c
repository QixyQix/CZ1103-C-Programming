/*
The salary scheme for a company is given as follows:
    Salary range for grade A: $700 - $899
    Salary range for grade B: $600 - $799
    Salary range for grade C: $500 - $649

In addition, a person whose salary is between $600 and $649 is in grade C if his merit points are below 10, 
otherwise he is in grade B. 

A person whose salary is between $700 and $799 is in grade B if his merit points are below 20, 
otherwise he is in grade A. 

Write a program to read in a personâ€™s salary and his merit points, and displays his grade.
